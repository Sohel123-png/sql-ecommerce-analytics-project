## 🗄 Database Schema

The system consists of three relational tables:

| Table           | Description                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **customer**    | Stores customer details and signup information        |
| **orders**      | Contains order transactions and total purchase amount |
| **order_items** | Includes product-level details for each order         |

Relationships:

* One customer → many orders
* One order → many order items
